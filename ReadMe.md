### Description of work ###

Movie app project 2 is  continuous work of project 1, which was created from scratch. Highlights of this project:
* Added Sqlite3 DB for data persistence.
* Added ContentProvider over DB storage.
* Replaced AsyncTask with SyncAdapter that periodically update the data layer. Manual refresh when data is day or more old.   
* Added 2 panes, master and detail side by side, for wide screen.
* Different portrait and landscape screen orientations.
* Replace GridView with RecyclerView. The RecyclerView has GridLayoutManager
* Added Movie Trailer video viewing if YouTube is available.
* The videos and reviews are retrieved on-demand. Once the items are retried, they are stores in database

### Special Notes ###

   `themoviedbApiKeyProp="your api key"`
* Citation: the code utilizes https://www.themoviedb.org/ APIs, copyrights of themoviewdb.org.
