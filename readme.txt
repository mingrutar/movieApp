ToDO:
   Replace the value (="replace-this-api_key") of "themoviedb_api_key" in string.xml with valid API_KEY.

Screenshots:
  Yet to learn how to insert images ?

Note: I implemented 2 ways to perform 'Sort by':
   1) through Menu/Settings/Sort by - required by the assignment;
   2) A Spinner at menu bar - the user could see the selected 'Sort by' option.
   The selections are synchronized.

Issues and Questions:
 1) What is good way to figure out the number of columns of a GridView on Nexus 6? Posted question at https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/109766100514206800627/s/ming
 2) The image of detail activity sometime is not shown for first time. Do I need to add some kind of notification with Picasso?
